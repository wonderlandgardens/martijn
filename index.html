          I'm a passionate design director and avid traveller with a deep
          appreciation for food, travel and gardening.

          Back in the day, I dreamed of starting an design studio (and a
          restaurant) in the heart of Amsterdam.

        <p class="im-a-passionate">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">
          Fast forward 9 years and I founded <a href="https://wonderland.studio/">WONDERLAND</a>, a digital brand studio
          dedicated to creating exceptional brand experiences that leave a
          lasting impression.
        </p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">
          With numerous digital awards and successful projects under our belt,
          we've helped companies achieve digital excellence in the ever-evolving
          noisy digital landscape.

        <p class="im-a-passionate">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">
          I also founded the <a href="https://wonderlandams.substack.com/">HUMAN newsletter</a> - acclaimed by industry peers for curating and writing about various creative topics, with over 38 campaigns to date. I'm also the founder of <a href="https://sustainabledigitaldesign.com/"> Sustainable Digital Design </a>, a platform for digital sustainability insights from industry experts and design communities.
        </p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">
          Over the past two decades I've won many digital awards, including
          ADCN, FWA, Awwwards, Lovies and a Webby. I judged or spoken at the Webby, Lovies and Awwwards, and before
          Wonderland I worked at JWT and TBWA.

        <p class="im-a-passionate">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="im-a-passionate">
          I studied Media & Communication in Amsterdam and then Design in London. (I still have a weakness for interior design
          though).
